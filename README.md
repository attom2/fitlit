## Project Description
This project is a beautiful dashboard for a user to view and see their latest activity data, goals, and milestones. It pulls from a number of separate datasets and analyzes their contents for the specific user. 
### Goals
Working with datasets, using classes and methods to manipulate the data. Display the data dynamically using DOM inter action so on page reload it pertains to the user. Use Test Driver Development to guide our creation and manipulation. 
We learned more about higher order javascript functions such as filter, reduce, and map. 
### Challenges
Dealing with data at a size that we haven't seen before. Being remote and communicating. Creating an aesthetically pleasing UI. Keeping DOM manipulation separate from data manipulation. 
### Wins
Learning about Test Driven Development. Getting the UI. Working remote with minimal merge conflicts.
### Programing Languages Used
HTML, JavaScript, CSS
